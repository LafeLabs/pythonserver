# Python Server

Social coding in Python.  To replicate this, copy the code in the global replicator linked below into a new file on a web server called replicator.php and run it.  Point browsers to that server, create new python programs, edit them and destroy them.  Replicate again from the command line using PHP to get them into a github repository and then change the url's in php/replicator.txt using editor.php, push that new code to your github, then copy the code in there into a new server to replicate out the code from your local server out to another local server.
